# Greg's RSS feed
Self-hosted, personal feed aggregator, built as a Python web app with flask.

Features a live button to trigger feed reload, a fuzzy search, persistent multi-theme switcher, the ability to parse and embed YouTube videos directly, a local storage-backed archive, a modal popup to display full articles or video descriptions complete with controls for adjusting font size.

I will be making updates to this project as my personal needs/use cases evolve.
